## Introduction

Welcome to the PANDAS Project repository, dedicated to the analysis of Netflix movie and TV show information. This document provides a detailed overview of the dataset, script functionality, step-by-step setup instructions, analysis insights, conclusion, and final thoughts.

### Dataset Description

The **data.csv** file in this repository contains a comprehensive dataset sourced from **netflixtitles.csv**. It encompasses a wide array of attributes related to Netflix titles, including metadata about movies and TV shows.

### Code Overview

The **index.py** script facilitates a robust pipeline for data preprocessing and analysis:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Engages in data cleaning and processing to ensure data quality.
   - Addresses missing values and performs necessary data type conversions.
   - Distinguishes between TV shows and movies for focused analysis.

2. **Analysis:**
   - **TV Shows Analysis:**
     - Delivers insights into TV show data, including counts, ratings, seasons, directors, cast, categories, languages, etc.
     - Presents statistical summaries and distributions for deeper understanding.
   - **Movies Analysis:**
     - Conducts similar analysis specifically tailored for movies.

### Instructions

#### Setup

Ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.)

1. Place **netflixtitles.csv** in the repository folder and rename it to **data.csv**.

#### Execution

Run the **index.py** script to initiate data preprocessing and analysis.

Review the console output for rich insights into Netflix TV shows and movies.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy

#### How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saianiruthm/pandasproject.git

```

Run the Python script:

```bash
python index.py
```

### Analysis Insights

#### Queries Answered by the Project

1. **Percentage of Each Content Type**
   - Calculated the percentage of different content types (Movies and TV Shows) in the dataset.

2. **Grouping Movies and TV Shows for Each Country**
   - Employed Groupby operations to create a DataFrame containing movies and TV shows grouped by country.

3. **Top 10 Directors with Most Netflix Titles**
   - Identified the top 10 directors with the highest count of Netflix movies and TV shows.

4. **Custom Insights**
   - Encouraged exploration to derive unique insights from the dataset.
